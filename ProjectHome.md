# pwgen — generate pronounceable passwords with PHP #
## Overview ##
_pwgen-php_ is a simple PHP class which aims to clone the [GNU pwgen](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pwgen/) functionality. It's designed to be used in existing scripts/projects.

The pwgen class generates passwords which are designed to be easily memorized by humans, while being as secure as possible. Human-memorable passwords are never going to be as secure as completely random passwords. In particular, passwords generated by pwgen without the `secure`-option should not be used in places where the password could be attacked via a brute-force attack.
On the other hand, completely randomly generated passwords have a tendency to be written down, and are subject to being compromised in that fashion.

## Usage ##
Generating a password is as simple as creating a new `PWGen` object and invoking the `generate()` function on it:

#### Generating a Password ####
```
<?php
    include('pwgen.class.php');
    $pwgen = new PWGen();
    $password = $pwgen->generate();
    echo $password;
?>
```

The output could be `Theik0Sa`, for example.

#### Generating Lots of Passwords ####
If you want to generate several passwords, it's wise in terms of performance and memory consumption, to use an existing `$pwgen` object multiple times. Every time you invoke the `generate()` function, a new password is generated.

```
    $pwgen = new PWGen();
    for($i=0; $i < 1000000; $i++) {
        $password = $pwgen->generate();
        echo $password;
    }
```

## Safety ##
#### Which Random Number Generator is Used? ####
[Debian's OpenSSL vulnerability](http://www.google.com/search?q=openssl+debian+vulnerability) in mind, questioning the random number generator is always a good idea.<br>
<i>pwgen-php</i> uses <a href='http://www.php.net/manual/function.mt-rand.php'>Mersenne Twister</a> on PHP 5.2. Mersenne Twister should not be used for cryptographic purposes, so I am working on refactoring that part. MT is part of the <a href='http://www.php.net/manual/function.mt-rand.php'>PHP core</a> since PHP 4 and a portable solution.<br>
<br>
<h4>Why Should I Trust You / the Generated Passwords?</h4>
In fact, you should not. <i>pwgen-php</i> is open source. I would be happy if you took a look at the <a href='http://code.google.com/p/pwgen-php/source/browse/'>source code</a> and report <a href='http://code.google.com/p/pwgen-php/issues/list'>issues or improvements</a>.<br>
<br>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
Due to the object oriented design, <i>pwgen-php</i> requires PHP 5.2+. It is developed and tested, however, only with 5.2.10, the latest version available on Debian Squeeze.<br>
<br>
<h2>License</h2>
<i>pwgen-php</i> may be distributed under the terms of the GPL License. Please also took a look at <a href='http://code.google.com/p/pwgen-php/issues/detail?id=1&can=1'>iusse #1</a>
